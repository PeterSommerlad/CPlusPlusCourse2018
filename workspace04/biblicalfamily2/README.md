This directory contains code demonstrating using shared_ptr 
for implementing object relationships.

This is the second step, showing the wrong use of shared_ptr for
cyclic relationships that results in objects no longer deleted.

NB: there are three more versions demonstrating modifications
when cyclic relationships, e.g., between parents and children 
in a family, are represented.
