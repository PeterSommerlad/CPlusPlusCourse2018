This small example shows how to read characters from standard input.

It can be used as a template for the exercises. 
But later in the semester you will learn other ways to perform the operation
in more flexible or robust ways.

**CAUTION**: Do not run this program within the Eclipse Console on Linux or MacOSX, 
because there the EOF-handling (CTRL-D) is broken. Run it in a separate Terminal
instead.
