*tolower.cpp* demonstrates looping over a stream's total input by characters using the unformatted I/O member functions `get(char)` and `put(char)`.
It also shows the `<cctype>`  character conversion function `tolower`. 

*CAUTION* Do not run this within the Cevelop Console on non-Windows operating systems, 
unless you have a very recent version of Cevelop, because
Eclipse has a bug with the EOF (Ctrl-D) handling in its console that only got fixed recently.
